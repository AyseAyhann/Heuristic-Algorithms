# **Heuristic Algorithms Projects**  

This repository contains projects related to the **Heuristic Algorithms** course.  

## **1. GPU Implementation of Optimization Algorithms**  
- Implements **Arithmetic Optimization**, **Dragonfly**, and **Grey Wolf Optimization** algorithms on **GPU**.  
- Compares execution times between **GPU and CPU** for performance analysis.  

## **2. Optimization Analysis**  
- Aims to find the **best results** for heuristic algorithms within **specified parameter ranges**.  

Both projects focus on analyzing and improving the efficiency of heuristic optimization techniques.
